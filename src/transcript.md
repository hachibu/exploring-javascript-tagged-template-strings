## Slide 1

Before I begin, I'd like to regale you with a joke that I wrote specifically
for this talk.

A torus and a doughnut are sitting next to each other in a bar. The torus says
to the doughnut, "Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you have a very
solid body." And the doughnut replies, "Why thank you, I toroidally agree."

Hello, my name is Raymond Sohn and I'm currently an engineer at Wootric which
is a platform for gathering and analyzing customer feedback. Tonight, we'll be
exploring JavaScript Tagged Template Strings. The objectives of this talk are to
show you: what they are, how they work and what they are capable of.

What are tagged template strings?

This is a terrible analogy (then why even mention it?), but a tagged template

to form something new and delicious. A tagged template string is basically a
burrito made out of a function and a template string.

Let's take a look at a real-life example of a tagged template string.
