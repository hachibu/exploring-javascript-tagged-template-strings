<p>Before I begin, I’d like to regale you with a joke that I wrote specifically for this talk.</p>
<p>A torus and a doughnut are sitting next to each other in a bar. The torus says to the doughnut, “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice that you have a very solid body.” And the doughnut replies, “Why thank you, I toroidally agree.”</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Raymond Sohn and I’m currently an engineer at Wootric which is a platform for gathering and analyzing customer feedback. Tonight, we’ll be exploring JavaScript Tagged Template Strings. The objectives of this talk are to show you: what they are, how they work and what they are capable of.</p>
<p>Before we continue, I think it’s worth explaining what template strings are because tagged template strings are a more specialized version of template strings. In order to understand tagged template strings, you need to understand template strings.</p>

<p>What is a template string?</p>
<p>Template strings are a fairly recent addition (2015) to the JavaScript programming language that allows us to quickly mix variables into strings.</p>
<h2 id="slide-3">Slide 3</h2>
<p>Before, we used to have to rely on the addition operator (<code>+</code>) to combine strings with variables. This could get very messy with large strings.</p>
<p>Now, we have a special syntax for mixing or interpolating variables into strings. We use backticks (`) to begin and end our template string and we can interpolate variables using the syntax: <code>${}</code>.</p>
<p>They are also nice because they preserve newlines and indentation.</p>

<p>What are tagged template strings?</p>
<p>This is a terrible analogy (then why even mention it?), but a tagged template string is like a burrito (okay, I’m listening).</p>
<p>Essentially, a burrito is a bunch of familiar ingredients wrapped in a tortilla to form something new and delicious. A tagged template string is basically a burrito made out of a function and a template string.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at a real-life example of a tagged template string.</p>
