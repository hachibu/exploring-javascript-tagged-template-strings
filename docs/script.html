<p>Take for example this GraphQL tag It doesn’t return a string it returns a GraphQL syntax object</p>
<p>If you’re intimidated by the might of tagged template strings, don’t be! They are easy to grok!</p>
<p>Tagged template strings are built out of 2 thing you already know about! Functions and template strings.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">Section 2</h1>
<p>A template tag that does nothing except prints its arguments A template tag that builds a template string The noop example is great because it establishes the simplest possible example, and thus gives a sense of the API shape and complexity.</p>
<p>So if we run the example from the last slide it behaves just like template string without a tag.</p>

<p>What else can we do with tagged template strings?</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the html2dom and md2dom examples because they feel very practical to use and solve problems folks see often.</li>
<li>The shell one blew my mind – such a terse and interesting syntax!</li>
<li>I like the async one because it demonstrates that the output of the template string can be very different (even async) from the input.</li>
</ul>
