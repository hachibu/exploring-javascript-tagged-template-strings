<p>Hello, my name is Raymond Sohn and I’m currently an engineer at Wootric which is a platform for gathering and analyzing customer feedback. Tonight, we’ll be exploring JavaScript Tagged Template Strings. By the end of this talk you’ll know what they are, how they work and what they are capable of.</p>
<p>Before we continue, I think it’s worth explaining what template strings are because tagged template strings are a more specialized version of template strings. In order to understand tagged template strings, you need to understand template strings.</p>

<p>What is a template string?</p>
<p>Template strings are a fairly recent addition to the JavaScript programming language that allows us to mix variables into strings.</p>
<h2 id="slide-3">Slide 3</h2>
<p>Before, we used to have to rely on the addition operator (<code>+</code>) to combine strings with variables. This could get very messy with large strings.</p>
<p><em>Demonstrate string concatenation by combining 2 pieces of paper with words written on them. Crumple them together and turn it into 1 piece of paper with both words on it.</em></p>
<p>Now, we have a special syntax for mixing or interpolating variables into strings. We use backticks (`) to begin and end our template string and we can interpolate variables using the syntax: <code>${}</code>.</p>
<p><em>Demonstrate string interpolation by using a paper with holes in it and a box to represent a variable, which contains a piece of paper inside which is the value. Take the paper out of the variable box, and slot the value into the hole.</em></p>

<p>What are tagged template strings?</p>
<p>This is a terrible analogy (then why even mention it?), but a tagged template string is like a burrito (okay, I’m listening).</p>
<p><em>Demonstrate by wrapping previous prop in a tortilla with a piece of paper that says function on it.</em></p>
<p>Essentially, a burrito is a bunch of familiar ingredients wrapped in a tortilla to form something new and delicious. A tagged template string is basically a burrito made out of a function and a template string.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a real-life example of a tagged template string.</p>

<p>Before I leave you, I’d like to regale you with a joke that I wrote specifically for WaffleJS.</p>
<p>A torus and a doughnut are sitting next to each other in a bar. The torus says to the doughnut, “Excuse me, I’ve been waffling over whether or not to approach you, but I couldn’t help but notice that you have a very solid body.” And the doughnut says, “Why thank you, I toroidally agree.”</p>
