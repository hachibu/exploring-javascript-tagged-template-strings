<p>Before I begin, I’d like to regale you with a joke that I wrote specifically for this talk.</p>
<p>A torus and a doughnut are sitting next to each other in a bar. The torus says to the doughnut, “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice that you have a very solid body.” And the doughnut replies, “Why thank you, I toroidally agree.”</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Raymond Sohn and I’m currently an engineer at Wootric which is a platform for gathering and analyzing customer feedback. Tonight, we’ll be exploring JavaScript Template Tags. The objectives of this talk are to show you: what they are, how they work and what they are capable of.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a very simple tag that prints it own arguments. Because in order to write our own tag we need to understand the arguments. Give you a sense of the API and complexity.</p>
<p>Let’s build upon the previous example. Now that we know how the arguments will be passed to our tag function we can actually do something about it.</p>

<p>Here is what I call the noop tag because it does nothing.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to construct your own tag, let’s move on to the final section. What else can we do with tag</p>
